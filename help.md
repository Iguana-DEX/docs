## How do I get started?

In order to use IguanaDEX, you need some $XTZ - this is the gas token for Etherlink and you need a little bit of $XTZ in order to submit any transaction to the network.

The [Etherlink Bridge](https://etherlinkbridge.com) automatically provides new users with a 0.1 XTZ airdrop whenever you bridge. So if you for example have some ETH on Ethereum or Base, you can use the [Etherlink Bridge](https://etherlinkbridge.com) website and bridge your ETH.

The ETH bridged will appear in your wallet as [WETH on Etherlink](https://explorer.etherlink.com/address/0xfc24f770F94edBca6D6f885E12d4317320BcB401).

You can then for example swap some of those WETH tokens for XTZ and make sure you don't run out of gas tokens!

## I'd like my project's token to be part of the default token list on IguanaDEX

There are a number of apps supporting early-stage tokens on Etherlink. On IguanaDEX in particular, you would typically get started by providing liquidity in a newly created pair between your token and WXTZ. We will however always be conservative when considering the addition of new tokens to the default list as our main objective remains the safety of our users' funds.
