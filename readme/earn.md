### Liquidity Pools <a href="#liquidity-pools" id="liquidity-pools"></a>

You can only swap tokens on IguanaDEX if there is enough liquidity for those tokens. If nobody has added much liquidity for the token or tokens you want to swap, it will be difficult, expensive, or impossible to do so.

Providing liquidity will get you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for making sure there's always liquidity for the exchange to use.

### Yield Farming <a href="#yield-farming" id="yield-farming"></a>

Yield farming lets users that are providing liquidity earn IGN rewards by locking their LP tokens into a smart contract. The incentive is to balance out the risk of [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) that comes along with locking in your liquidity.
