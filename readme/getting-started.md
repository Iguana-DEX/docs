# ðŸ‘‹ Getting Started

IguanaDEX lets users [Trade](trade.md) & [Earn](earn.md) without the need to go through a Centralized Exchange or counterparty.

All you need to get started is a wallet and here are some examples:

* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
* [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
* [Rabby Wallet](https://rabby.io/)\


Here is a tutorial showing you how to set up MetaMask:

MetaMask and the other wallets listed above are browser extensions. You would typically use them within Chrome, Firefox or Brave browser.

Once you're done with this, browse to [https://iguanadex.com](https://iguanadex.com) to start trading!
