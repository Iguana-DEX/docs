# Bridge tokens to Etherlink

The [Etherlink Bridge](https://bridge.etherlink.com) allows you to bring your tokens from any chain to Etherlink



## Video guide - walk-through of the Bridge by the folks over at Etherlink:

## Written guide:

The following guide uses BNB Chain as an example. The same process can be applied to any other chain supported by the [Etherlink Bridge](https://bridge.etherlink.com). If for example you have some tokens on Ethereum or Polygon instead, you can do the exact same thing and your tokens will end up on Etherlink.

1 - Make sure that your wallet supports both BNB Chain and Etherlink. We recommend using MetaMask.

Then open the [Etherlink Bridge](https://bridge.etherlink.com).

2 - First, let’s connect your wallet to the bridge.

Click "Connect" and choose your preferred wallet.

Then confirm and approve in your wallet popup.

3 - Click the "v" in the upper token selection field and search for the symbol of the token you would like to bridge. In our case "USDT":

</div>

Make sure to select the right chain - in our case "BNB Chain".

4 - The “Network” you are sending those tokens to will automatically be set to Etherlink for you.

5 - Input the number of USDT you want to send from BNB Chain to Etherlink **in the upper section**.

6 - Note that the bridge will send a small amount of XTZ tokens to your address on Etherlink if you do not already have some in your wallet. This is useful because you will need some XTZ tokens in order to submit transactions on Etherlink.

7 - Click "Transfer" to initiate the bridging transaction and confirm via the wallet confirmation pop-up.

Please note that you must approve two transactions when you try to bridge for the first time. The first transaction is to approve USDT.

8 - Sit back and relax. The operation should only take a minute or so. Once the bridging is complete, USDT will be deposited to your Etherlink address. You can monitor the progress of the operation by looking at the progress bar.
