# üëã Getting Started

All you need to get started is a wallet and here are some examples of browser extension wallets:

* [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
* [Rabby Wallet](https://rabby.io/)\


Here is a tutorial showing you how to set up MetaMask:

Once you have set up your wallet, you will need some tokens on Etherlink - the chain where IguanaDEX lives.

If you _already_ have tokens on another chain:
