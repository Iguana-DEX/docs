# On-ramp to Etherlink

If you do not have any cryptocurrency yet, you can get some in a few ways:

* Centralized Exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) let you deposit fiat currencies. You can then convert your fiat currencies for crypto and send them&#x20;
* [Monerium](https://monerium.app/): uses a Euro stablecoin, symbol EURe. On-ramping / off-ramping is free and you can then convert your EURe to USDC on Polygon and [bridge them to Etherlink](bridge-tokens-to-etherlink.md).&#x20;



The above methods are recommended as they either do not charge or charge low fees for on-ramping/off-ramping.



If you are unable to use them, you can also use an on-ramp that allows you to pay with a credit card:

* [Mercuryo](https://my.mercuryo.io/login/email)
* [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy)
* [Transak](https://global.transak.com/)
