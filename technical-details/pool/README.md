# ðŸ’° Pool

The DMI Pool uses features from two major protocols:

* Balancer
* GMX

IguanaDEX used Balancer's feature-rich Managed Pool as a base for the design of the DMI Pool.



The DMI Pool however benefits from an important added source of fees with the DMI perpetual swap offering in Iguana.

This setup is similar to GMX's GLP setup in IguanaDEX v1.
