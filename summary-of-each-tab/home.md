## The Home of the Digital Market Index

The 'Home' tab provides some information about the Digital Market Index.

The Digital Market Index is an _**index of 10 coins**_ with the weight of each coin being based on its [Y+10 Marketcap as reported by Messari](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].&#x20;

There is also an 11th coin added to the index with a fixed weight of 10%: Tether USD (USDT) is a stablecoin linked 1-to-1 to the US Dollar and issued by [Tether Operations Limited](https://tether.to/en/).



The aim of the Digital Market Index is to provide investors with a transparent benchmark of the crypto space, one that can be tracked easily (and profitably!) by the DMI token - more on that in the [Pool section](pool.md).

### Current information

You can see which coins are currently in the index and what weights have been assigned to each of those coins.&#x20;

### Time Machine

The first table shows a historical (simulated) view of the index composition, every single month since January 2018.

[^1]: The Y+10 Marketcap is the marketcap of the asset accounting for known issuance 10 years into the future. It is calculated by multiplying the current Price USD of the asset by its Y+10 Supply.
