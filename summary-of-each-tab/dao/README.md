## Overview

IguanaDEX Governance is the heart and brain of IguanaDEX.

All IGN token holders can be part of the IguanaDEX Governance Process.

Governance makes decisions about new features and directions of where IguanaDEX should go. Governance is the ultimate decision body for the IguanaDEX. No one can override vote results.

## [Governance Process](governance-process/)

The IguanaDEX Governance Process tracks an initiative from discussion, to proposal, to a vote, to enactment. It is designed to be an open, transparent, and intuitive way to progress the future of the protocol.

## [IGN Governance Token](bal-governance-token.md)

IGN holders vote on proposals relevant to the protocol. These proposals are wide ranging, from Governable Protocol Fees to how IGN Tokens themselves are distributed into the future.

## [Snapshot](snapshot.md)

Snapshot is an off-chain gas-less multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. IguanaDEX Governance Votes take place on Snapshot.

## [Multisig](multisig.md)

To enact the off-chain votes on Snapshot, IguanaDEX uses a Multisig to solidify these changes on-chain. IguanaDEXâ€™s Multisig signers are a diverse set of widely respected community members. The Multisig does NOT have decision-making power, as its role is simply to enact on-chain the decisions IGN holders make via off-chain voting.

## [Governable Protocol Fees](governable-protocol-fees.md)

IGN holders have the power to enable and modify Governable Protocol Fees. These can be collected from trading fees and stored in the Vault. Token holders themselves also get to decide what becomes of these fees, and how to best spend them to support the health and progress of the protocol.
