# Snapshot

## Overview

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/), a spinoff of Balancer, is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.

Snapshot derives its name from taking a "snapshot" of the blockchain at a certain block number before voting opens. By having a fixed point in time, this eliminates the need to worry about malicious users moving their tokens to vote multiple times or someone using a flash loan to borrow a ton of voting power.

## Eligibility/How to Vote

In order to be eligible to [vote on I](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer)guanaDEX proposals, you need to hold IGN tokens.

When a vote opens, click on the proposal in the IguanaDEX Space, scroll to the voting section, and cast your vote. Your wallet provider will ask you to sign a message (don't worry, you won't be charged any gas).
