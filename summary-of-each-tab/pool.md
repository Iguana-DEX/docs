## Invest your coins in the DMI Pool to collect DMI tokens

While the 'Home' tab is all about the Digital Market Index, the 'Pool' tab focuses on the DMI Pool.

The DMI Pool is set up to track the Digital Market Index.

Just like the Digital Market Index, there are 11 coins in the DMI Pool. The weights of each coin also closely matches their weight in the Digital Market Index.



### Investing into the DMI Pool

Anyone can deposit one or more of the 11 coins in the DMI Pool to _**get broad exposure**_ to crypto markets and _**collect the fees**_ paid by the traders interacting with the DMI Pool.



#### Example:

Alice wants to invest in the DMI Pool. She owns 1 BNB but none of the other coins in the pool. => No problem!

Alice can go ahead and deposit her 1 BNB into the pool. She will then be issued some _DMI tokens_ in exchange.

### DMI token: what is it?

The DMI token is a receipt issued by the DMI Pool when someone deposits coins into the pool.

Holders of DMI tokens can decide at any time to hand over their $DMI to the DMI Pool in exchange for their share of the pool.



#### Example:&#x20;

Alice owns some $DMI. She can decide at any time to send her $DMI back to the DMI Pool and she will then receive her share of the pool's coins.

Alice can also elect to redeem her $DMI for only 1 or a few of the coins in the pool instead for convenience.



### What else can DMI token holders do with their tokens?

We have seen above that $DMI can be sent back to the pool in exchange for their corresponding share of the pool at any time.

But $DMI holders can do a lot more with their tokens!

* Sell their tokens on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en)
* Deposit their tokens on [Venus Protocol](https://venus.io/) in order to borrow other coins against them
* Deposit their tokens on [Abracadabra](https://abracadabra.money/) and borrow $MIM stablecoins against them
* And much more!



### Where do the fees come from?

$DMI holders bring large liquidity to BNB Chain and this liquidity is used in 2 main ways:

#### Spot Trading

The DMI Pool contains 11 coins, so every possible combination of 2 coins can be traded -> that's _**55 trading pairs!**_

For the math-inclined among us, here is the formula: $$\frac{11!}{2!(11-2)!}$$= 55.



So anyone looking to trade say BTC for BNB or XRP for BUSD can do so on the DMI Pool directly on IguanaDEX.

IguanaDEX will be integrated with all major spot trading aggregators e.g. [1Inch](https://1inch.io/), [KyberSwap](https://kyberswap.com/), [ParaSwap](https://www.paraswap.io/), [Firebird](https://firebird.finance/) and even cross-chain aggregators like [Rango](https://rango.exchange/) benefitting from cheap bridging to and from BNB Chain via [Multichain](https://multichain.org/) and other bridges.

#### Leverage Trading

The DMI Pool provides liquidity for leverage trading.

The pool therefore collects the fees paid by leverage traders on the platform.

As the pool takes the other side of every single leverage trade initiated on the platform, it will profits when leverage traders make a loss and vice versa. Past PnL data will be made available on the 'Home' tab.
