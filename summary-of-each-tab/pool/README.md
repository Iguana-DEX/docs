## Invest your coins in the [DMI Pool](dmi-pool.md) to collect DMI tokens

While the 'Home' tab is all about the Digital Market Index, the 'Invest' tab focuses on the DMI Pool.

The DMI Pool is set up to track the Digital Market Index.

Just like the Digital Market Index, there are 11 coins in the DMI Pool. The weights of each coin also closely matches their weight in the Digital Market Index.



## Provide liquidity in the [IGN/USDT Pool](ign-usdt-pool.md)

IguanaDEX has its own token: the Iguana token (symbol: $IGN).

The IGN/USDT Pool provides liquidity for purchases and sales of $IGN.

Deposit $IGN and/or $USDT into the pool to collect trading fees.
