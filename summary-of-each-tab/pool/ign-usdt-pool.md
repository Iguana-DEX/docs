#### Revenue Model: Make Monday great again!

_100% of all revenues_ generated by IguanaDEX goes to Iguana token holders.

This revenue is paid once a week, every _Monday_.



As an $IGN holder, each Monday you have 4 choices:

* \$$ - Claim your share of IguanaDEX's weekly revenue distribution and go spend it
* $DMI - Claim your share and automatically invest it into the DMI Pool
* $IGN - Claim your share and automatically reinvest it into more IGN tokens
* Not claim right away - you can claim multiple weekly revenue distributions at once within 6 months of the revenue distribution date
