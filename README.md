## What is IguanaDEX?

IguanaDEX is a [Decentralized Exchange](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex) deployed on [<mark style="color:yellow;">BNB Chain</mark>](https://www.bnbchain.org/).



**Traders** can buy and sell the biggest coins in crypto. Traders can also get long or short exposure to the [Digital Market Index](summary-of-each-tab/home.md#the-home-of-the-digital-market-index) - the benchmark of the crypto ecosystem - by trading the DMI token.



**Investors** can provide liquidity to traders by investing in the DMI token itself.&#x20;

Every coin invested in the DMI token will be sitting in the DMI pool and used efficiently to provide liquidity on a variety of spot and derivative markets.
