# ü¶é IguanaDEX Intro



The app is a [Decentralized Exchange](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex) deployed on the [Etherlink](https://etherlink.com) blockchain.

IguanaDEX lets users [Trade](readme/trade.md) & [Earn](readme/earn.md) without the need to go through a Centralized Exchange or counterparty.

The code is based on the concept of [concentrated liquidity](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/concentrated-liquidity) pools created by [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org) (v3).
